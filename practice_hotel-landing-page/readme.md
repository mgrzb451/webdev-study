# A practice project recreating the gorgeous [Serry Resort's website](https://www.theserry.com/en)

Before moving on to learning javascript I wanted to do one last small project to review and consolidate what I've learned so far.

I found this simple, elegant website of a luxurious resort in Egypt and decided to recreate it to the best of my current ability.

## What I practiced

- CSS nesting - discovered several caveats I'll keep in mind (and notes ðŸ˜‰)
- making an element sticky in relation to its parent vs the entire page
- using `@keyframes` for animations and their relation to CSS nesting
- realized more opportunities for shared/utility classes that can be defined once and then added te HTML elements making everything more concise
- making the webpage more responsive with `clamp()` and `@media`

## The result
