# MDN Challenge: Typesetting a community school homepage

My very first webpage practice project. Thank you mdn for this [practice challenge](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Typesetting_a_homepage)

## Concepts I explored:
* Very basics of HTML structure; using semantically appropriate elements
* Very basics of CSS
  * Using selectors, pseudo classes and elements
  * Working with `flexbox`
  * Trying to structure my .css document in a logical way, but given a dearth of rigid guidelines I'm left stumbling and trying out different approaches. Next time I'll try to split the file into sections for each major HTML part
  * Trying (and failing) to use `clamp()` for setting widths, but I think I know what I did wrong; having some fun with `transition` and `position: sticky`
 
## My result
